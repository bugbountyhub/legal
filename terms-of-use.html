  <h2 class="h3 mt-12 mb-8">2. Description of the platform</h2>
  <p>
    <span>
      Many companies cannot afford independently organized bug bounty programs
      or platforms due to the technical, organizational and legal effort
      involved. This is where the Bug Bounty Hub platform comes in: The platform
      enables the customer to create and manage an individual bug bounty program
      via the Bug Bounty Hub platform and offers both the friendly hackers and
      the customers legal protection in the form of a &quot;legal safe
      harbor&quot;. As long as the Friendly Hackers stay within the framework
      set by the Customers, they are not liable to prosecution because the
      Customers have given their prior consent to such hacking activities. Any
      vulnerabilities are reported by the Friendly Hackers exclusively via the
      Bug Bounty Hub platform. The platform ensures the secure storage of this
      information and checks reported vulnerabilities for verifiability and
      novelty. It then categorizes verifiable vulnerabilities that are not
      already known in terms of their severity and criticality. Depending on the
      severity of a vulnerability (&quot;bug&quot;), it then awards a reward
      (&quot;bounty&quot;) and transfers the corresponding amount of money to
      the Friendly Hacker&#39;s account. The categories of vulnerabilities and
      the associated rewards can be viewed on the platform&#39;s website for
      registered Friendly Hackers, with the rewards being determined by the
      customers for the respective bug bounty program.
    </span>
  </p>

  <h2 class="h3 mt-12 mb-8">3. Services of the platform</h2>
  <p>

  <h2 class="h3 mt-12 mb-8">4. Duties of the Friendly Hackers</h2>
  <ol>
    <li class="mt-2">
      <span>
        In order to participate in a bug bounty program via the platform,
        Friendly Hackers must register with at least their first and last name,
        postal address, email address and telephone number and accept these
        Terms of Use. In order to receive a reward, they must also provide a
        bank account in their name (IBAN plus name and postal address). In
        addition, they must accept the individual terms and conditions of each
        bug bounty program in which they wish to participate. These may prohibit
        further hacking methods in addition to the unauthorized hacking methods
        listed below and may also impose other conditions that go beyond these
        terms of use.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2">
      <span>
        The Friendly Hackers are responsible for their account and must in
        particular ensure that the access data is inaccessible to third parties.
        By accepting the Terms of Use, Friendly Hackers consent to the
        disclosure of their contact information to the customers of the bug
        bounty programs in which they participate.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2">
      <span>
        By accepting these Terms of Use, Friendly Hackers commits to documenting
        information about found vulnerabilities exclusively via the
        platform&#39;s designated reporting form and not in other places. They
        also agree to keep the vulnerability found secret for 90 days after
        reporting it on the platform. Finally, they undertake to upload to the
        platform data from the customers to which they have gained access as
        part of a bug bounty program and to subsequently delete any local copies
        and not to disseminate them further.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2">
      <span>
        By accepting the terms of use, Friendly Hackers undertakes to refrain
        from methods that have a negative impact on the tested applications or
        their users. Among others these are:
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li class="mt-2">
          <span>Social engineering</span>
        </li>
        <li class="mt-2">
          <span>Spamming</span>
        </li>
        <li class="mt-2">
          <span>Phishing</span>
        </li>
        <li class="mt-2">
          <span> Denial of service attacks or other bruteforce attacks </span>
        </li>
        <li class="mt-2">
          <span>Physical attacks</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li class="mt-2">
      <span>
        In addition to the improper hacking methods listed in Section 4.4, the
        Friendly Hackers are required to immediately discontinue vulnerability
        hunting if they determine that their conduct will result in a
        significant degradation (negative impact on regular users or on the
        operations team) of the Platform&#39;s or Service&#39;s operations.
      </span>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 class="h3 mt-12 mb-8">5. Duties of the customers</h2>
  <ol>
    <li class="mt-2">
      <span>
        When setting up a bug bounty program via the platform, customers must
        define the scope of the program. The scope defines for which services of
        the customer the bug bounty program should apply. In particular, they
        can include or exclude certain domains and/or subdirectories from the
        scope. The additional information required for the scope can be found in
        the corresponding form.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2">
      <span>
        By accepting the Terms of Use, Customers consent to the use of hacking
        methods by Friendly Hackers on their designated websites and software.
        Excluded are the methods listed in section 4.4 and in the bug bounty
        program. Due to the consent of the customers, the criminal liability
        criterion of unauthorized obtaining/unauthorized use and thus the
        criminal liability of the Friendly Hackers with regard to the criminal
        offenses in Art. 143 Swiss Criminal Code (Unauthorised obtaining of
        data) and Art.&nbsp;143
      </span>
      <span class="c26">bis</span>
      <span>
        &nbsp;Swiss Criminal Code (Unauthorised access to a data processing
        system) does not apply.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2">
      <span>
        Customers undertake to pay the prices according to the price list for
        the services of the platform as well as a sum chosen by them, which will
        be used as a bounty in the event of the discovery of new and traceable
        vulnerabilities for the payment of Friendly Hackers. The fee for the
        platform&#39;s services and the sum designated for rewards must be
        transferred to the platform operator prior to the start of a bug bounty
        program or pledged, e.g., in the form of a Purchase Order (PO). The
        reward for the Friendly Hacker including the handling fee of the
        platform must be transferred within 15 days after definite confirmation
        of the bug. An advance payment of the sums provided annually for rewards
        is also possible..
      </span>
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2">
      <span>
        The bug bounty program started by a Customer will run until it is paused
        or stopped by the Customer. Customers agree to pay Bounties for Bugs
        found during an ongoing (i.e. not paused or stopped) Bug Bounty Program.
      </span>

  </ol>

  <h2 class="h3 mt-12 mb-8">6. Evaluation and payment of bounties</h2>

  <ol>
    <li class="mt-2">
      <span>
        The bugs reported by Friendly Hackers via the platform will be evaluated
        by the platform operator within 5 days with regard to their novelty and
        verifiability and, if they are new and verifiable, confirmed in a
        category and thus in a reward according to the bounty list of the
        respective bug bounty program.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2">
      <span>

        The reward for finding and reporting a new and verifiable bug will be
        transferred to the bank account of the Friendly Hacker concerned
        specified during registration within 30 days after definite confirmation
        of the bug.

        The contract between the platform and the Friendly Hackers comes into
        effect with the registration of an account and the acceptance of the
        terms of use. The contract can be terminated by the Friendly Hackers at
        any time by deleting the Account. The contract can also be terminated by
