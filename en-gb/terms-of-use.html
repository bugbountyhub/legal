  <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      A
      <strong>Bug Bounty Program</strong>

      &nbsp;is a company-driven initiative to identify, fix and disclose
      software bugs and security vulnerabilities (hereinafter Vulnerabilities)
      by offering financial rewards to the discoverers.
    </li>
    <li>
      The
      <strong>Go Bug Free Platform</strong>

      (hereinafter:<strong>Platform</strong>) is a platform operated by Bug
      Bounty Hub AG (Platform Operator), which offers its customers (Customers)
      to run a bug bounty program.
    </li>
    <li>
      A
      <strong>Customer</strong>

      &nbsp;is a company who uses the Platform&#39;s offer to find
      vulnerabilities in its software and to fix them before they become
      publicly known.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Friendly Hackers</strong>

      &nbsp;are security experts who participate in a bug bounty program and are
      rewarded for finding bugs in the Customers&#39; software.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>2. Description of the platform</h2>
  <p>
    Many companies cannot afford independently organized bug bounty programs or
    platforms due to the technical, organizational and legal effort involved.
    This is where the Go Bug Free platform comes in: The platform enables the
    customer to create and manage an individual bug bounty program via the Bug
    Bounty Hub platform and offers both the friendly hackers and the customers
    legal protection in the form of a &quot;legal safe harbor&quot;. As long as
    the Friendly Hackers stay within the framework set by the Customers, they
    are not liable to prosecution because the Customers have given their prior
    consent to such hacking activities. Any vulnerabilities are reported by the
    Friendly Hackers exclusively via the Go Bug Free platform. The platform
    ensures the secure storage of this information and checks reported
    vulnerabilities for verifiability and novelty. It then categorizes
    verifiable vulnerabilities that are not already known in terms of their
    severity and criticality. Depending on the severity of a vulnerability
    (&quot;bug&quot;), it then awards a reward (&quot;bounty&quot;) and
    transfers the corresponding amount of money to the Friendly Hacker&#39;s
    account. The categories of vulnerabilities and the associated rewards can be
    viewed on the platform&#39;s website for registered Friendly Hackers, with
    the rewards being determined by the customers for the respective bug bounty
    program.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Services of the platform</h2>
  <p>
    The Platform offers Customers a bug bounty platform through which the
    Customer can operate its individual bug bounty program. This includes the
    following services, unless otherwise specified in the selected service type
    of the platform:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Verification of the Friendly Hackers&#39; identity according to the
      various identity verification levels.
    </li>
    <li>
      Assurance that only those Friendly Hackers participate in a bug bounty
      program who have accepted the general and per Customer individual terms of
      use and rules for Friendly Hackers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Review of vulnerabilities reported by Friendly Hackers for novelty and
      verifiability.
    </li>
    <li>
      Review of the severity classification of new and verifiable
      vulnerabilities initially determined by the Friendly Hacker.
    </li>
    <li>
      Providing a discussion platform between the Customer and the Friendly
      Hacker for queries regarding reported vulnerabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
      Securely storing information about vulnerabilities until they are fixed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Information about vulnerabilities already found for Friendly Hackers
      participating in the bug bounty program concerned (to exclude multiple
      reports).
    </li>
    <li>
      Payment of rewards for new and verifiable vulnerabilities according to the
      customer&#39;s individual bounty list.
    </li>
    <li>
      If uncertainties arise during the validation of a vulnerability, the platform contacts the customer. The customer can then provide helpful information for the validation. In case of doubt, the platform decides on the basis of the information provided by Friendly Hacker and the customer. The decision must be justified by the platform.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Duties of the Friendly Hackers</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      In order to participate in a bug bounty program via the platform, Friendly
      Hackers must register with at least their first and last name, postal
      address, email address and telephone number and accept these Terms of Use.
      A minimum age of 18 years applies. By accepting the Terms of Use, Friendly
      Hackers assure to be at least 18 years old. In order to receive a reward,
      they must also provide a bank account in their name (IBAN plus name and
      postal address). In addition, they must accept the individual terms and
      conditions of each bug bounty program in which they wish to participate.
      These may prohibit further hacking methods in addition to the unauthorized
      hacking methods listed below and may also impose other conditions that go
      beyond these terms of use.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Friendly Hackers are responsible for their account and must in
      particular ensure that the access data is inaccessible to third parties.
      By accepting the Terms of Use, Friendly Hackers consent to the disclosure
      of their contact information to the customers of the bug bounty programs
      in which they participate.
    </li>
    <li>
      By accepting these Terms of Use, Friendly Hackers commits to documenting
      information about found vulnerabilities exclusively via the platform&#39;s
      designated reporting form and not in other places. They also agree to keep
      the vulnerability found secret for 90 days after reporting it on the
      platform. Finally, they undertake to upload to the platform data from the
      customers to which they have gained access as part of a bug bounty program
      and to subsequently delete any local copies and not to disseminate them
      further.
    </li>
    <li>
      By accepting the terms of use, Friendly Hackers undertakes to refrain from
      methods that have a negative impact on the tested applications or their
      users. Among others these are:

      <ul>
        <li>Social engineering</li>
        <li>Spamming</li>
        <li>Phishing</li>
        <li>Denial of service attacks or other bruteforce attacks</li>
        <li>Physical attacks</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      In addition to the improper hacking methods listed in Section 4.4, the
      Friendly Hackers are required to immediately discontinue vulnerability
      hunting if they determine that their conduct will result in a significant
      degradation (negative impact on regular users or on the operations team)
      of the Platform&#39;s or Service&#39;s operations.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>5. Duties of the customers</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      When setting up a bug bounty program via the platform, customers must
      define the scope of the program. The scope defines for which services of
      the customer the bug bounty program should apply. In particular, they can
      include or exclude certain domains and/or subdirectories from the scope.
      The additional information required for the scope can be found in the
      corresponding form.
    </li>
    <li>
      By accepting the Terms of Use, Customers consent to the use of hacking
      methods by Friendly Hackers on their designated websites and software.
      Excluded are the methods listed in section 4.4 and in the bug bounty
      program. Due to the consent of the customers, the criminal liability
      criterion of unauthorized obtaining/unauthorized use and thus the criminal
      liability of the Friendly Hackers with regard to the criminal offenses in
      Art. 143 Swiss Criminal Code (Unauthorised obtaining of data) and
      Art.&nbsp;143

      <sup>bis</sup>

      &nbsp;Swiss Criminal Code (Unauthorised access to a data processing
      system) does not apply.
    </li>
    <li>
      Customers undertake to pay the prices according to the price list for the
      services of the platform as well as a sum chosen by them, which will be
      used as a bounty in the event of the discovery of new and traceable
      vulnerabilities for the payment of Friendly Hackers. The fee for the
      platform&#39;s services and the sum designated for rewards must be
      transferred to the platform operator prior to the start of a bug bounty
      program or pledged, e.g., in the form of a Purchase Order (PO). The reward
      for the Friendly Hacker including the handling fee of the platform must be
      transferred within 15 days after definite confirmation of the bug. An
      advance payment of the sums provided annually for rewards is also
      possible..
    </li>
    <li>
      The bug bounty program started by a Customer will run until it is paused
      or stopped by the Customer. Customers agree to pay Bounties for Bugs found
      during an ongoing (i.e. not paused or stopped) Bug Bounty Program.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>6. Evaluation and payment of bounties</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The bugs reported by Friendly Hackers via the platform will be evaluated
      by the platform operator within 10 days with regard to their novelty and
      verifiability and, if they are new and verifiable, confirmed in a category
      and thus in a reward according to the bounty list of the respective bug
      bounty program. If feedback from the customer is required, it may take 
      longer to process the submitted bug.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unless otherwise defined in the bug bounty program, the rating is verified
      by means of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>low: 0.1 &ndash; 3.9</li>
      <li>medium: 4.0 &ndash; 6.9</li>
      <li>high: 7.0 &ndash; 8.9</li>
      <li>critical: 9.0 - 10</li>
    </ul>

    <li>
      The reward for finding and reporting a new and verifiable bug will be
      transferred to the bank account of the Friendly Hacker concerned specified
      during registration within 40 days after definite confirmation of the bug.
    </li>
    <li>
      Multiple vulnerabilities caused by one underlying problem are rewarded
      with one premium.
    </li>
    <li>
      The platform is entitled to reject reported bugs if they are not new
      and/or not verifiable. Thereby any claim for compensation is forfeited.
    </li>
    <li>
      The following vulnerabilities and forms of documentation are generally not
      sought and are rejected:

      <ul>
        <li>
          Best practices that do not lead to a directly exploitable
          vulnerability (e.g., missing security headers).
        </li>
        <li class="c8">
          Vulnerabilities due to third-party software libraries for which the
          vulnerabilities are already known.
        </li>
        <li>
          Documentations of automatic tools without additional explanations.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>7. Contract term</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The contract between the platform and the Friendly Hackers comes into
      effect with the registration of an account and the acceptance of the terms
      of use. The contract can be terminated by the Friendly Hackers at any time
      by deleting the Account. The contract can also be terminated by the
      platform at any time without giving reasons and the account access of the
      Friendly Hacker can be deactivated.
    </li>
    <li>
      The contract between the platform and the Customers is concluded upon
      registration of an Account and acceptance of the Terms of Use. The
      contract may be terminated by the Customers at any time by deleting the
      Account. The contract can also be terminated by the platform without
      giving reasons at the end of the term. In the event of termination of the
      contract between the platform and the customers, any credit balance will
      be refunded.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>8. Liability</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The Customers are solely responsible for any damage that occurs within the
      scope of the hacking permitted by the Scope. Civil or criminal action
      against Friendly Hacker or the platform is excluded in this case.
    </li>
    <li>
      If a Friendly Hacker does not adhere to the specified scope and damage
      occurs as a result, the Friendly Hacker alone is responsible for this. If
      there is evidence of a justified suspicion that the Customers have
      exceeded the scope, the platform will block the account of the offending
      Friendly Hacker(s). Any further liability of the platform is excluded.
    </li>
    <li>
      The platform shall ensure a safe storage of the information about found
      vulnerabilities according to the state of the art. In the event that third
      parties are able to access such information despite the protective
      measures taken and damage occurs as a result, the Platform&#39;s liability
      is excluded..
    </li>
    <li>
      The platform shall ensure the best possible availability. The platform
      shall not be liable for any damage resulting from an unavailability of the
      platform..
    </li>
    <li>
      Friendly Hackers are responsible for correctly declaring their earnings
      (rewards for found bugs) according to the law applicable to them. The
      platform excludes any liability due to incorrect declaration of earnings
      by the Friendly Hackers. For Friendly Hackers residing in Switzerland, the
      lack of economic and work-organizational dependence means that there is no
      dependent employment and thus no obligation to pay social security
      contributions.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>9. Final provisions</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The platform is entitled to have all or individual services, which it is
      obligated to provide in accordance with these Terms of Use, provided by
      subcontractors also abroad.
    </li>
    <li>
      Communications from the Platform to Customers and Friendly Hackers shall
      be made by secure e-mail or via the Platform.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Platform may amend these Terms of Use. The version of the Terms of Use
      available online shall apply in each case.
    </li>
    <li>
      Contracts between the Platform and the Friendly Hackers or between the
      Platform and the Customers shall be governed exclusively by Swiss law. The
      contracts between the Platform and Friendly Hackers, or between the
      Platform and the Customers, shall be governed exclusively by Swiss
      substantive law, excluding international conventions, including the United
      Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods of
      April 11, 1980 (CISG) and the conflict of laws rules.
    </li>
    <li>The exclusive place of jurisdiction is Zurich.</li>
