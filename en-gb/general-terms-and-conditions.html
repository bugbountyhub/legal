      and implementation of contracts between customers (hereinafter referred to
      as &quot;Customer(s)&quot;) and the COMPANY.
    </li>
    <li>
      x The GTCs are an integral part of all offers/quotations and contracts
      between the Customer and the COMPANY. Collateral agreements, amendments,
      or additions to the GTCs or the offer are only valid if they are confirmed
      in writing or by email.
    </li>
    <li>
      General terms and conditions of the Customer or other contractual
      provisions in other ready-made documents of the Customer (such as order
      forms or purchase orders) explicitly do not apply in relation to the
      services of the COMPANY.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the case of SaaS services, the respective terms of use also apply.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the event of any contradictions, the offer shall take precedence over
      the terms of use for SaaS Services and the terms of use for SaaS services
      shall take precedence over these GTCs.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>2. Conclusion of contract</h2>

    <li>
      Unless otherwise specified in the offer, the COMPANY shall remain bound by
      the offer for 30 days from its date of issue.
    </li>
    <li>
      The contract shall be concluded by signing a separate contract or by
      accepting the offer in writing.
    </li>
    <li>
      If subsequent changes to the order/contract result in additional costs for
      the COMPANY, these shall be borne by the Customer in accordance with the
      company&rsquo;s rates at that time.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>3. Remuneration/Terms of Payment</h2>

    <li>
      All prices in all offers and contracts between the Customer and the
      COMPANY are net, without discount, in Swiss francs and exclusive of VAT.

      under these GTCs, or any increase thereof, shall be borne by the Customer.
    </li>
    <li>
      The remuneration covers all services necessary for the proper performance
      of the contract. Expenses and incidental costs incurred by the COMPANY
      will be charged additionally.

    <li>
      Invoices issued by the COMPANY for services arising from all contractual
      relationships shall be payable within 30 days of the date of the invoice.
      The Customer acknowledges that in the event of non-payment of an invoice

    </li>
    <li>
      The Customer shall immediately notify the COMPANY in writing of any
      disputes regarding invoices issued.

  </ol>

  <h2>4. General Obligations of the Customer to Cooperate</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The Customer shall assist the COMPANY in the provision of its services to
      the extent reasonable, necessary, and appropriate. Among other things, the
      Customer shall always ensure that (a) the COMPANY receives all
      information, documents, and data required for the performance of the
      contract in a timely, complete, and correct manner; (b) the Customer has
      fulfilled the necessary requirements for the provision of the services
      (such as, in particular, the provision of adequate IT and communications
      infrastructure, access to the Customer&#39;s systems, access to buildings,
      the provision of suitable premises and office services); and (c) key
      personnel and other specialized personnel of the Customer are available to
      a reasonable extent to enable the provision of the contracted services by
      the COMPANY.
    </li>

      the relevant contract.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>5. Confidentiality</h2>

    <li>
      The contracting parties shall treat as confidential all facts that are
      neither public knowledge nor generally accessible.

    <li>
      This obligation to maintain confidentiality also exists prior to the
      conclusion of the contract and after the termination of the contractual

      agents are completely excluded, irrespective of the legal grounds, with
      respect to any damage or loss arising in the course of the provision of
      services. However, this exclusion of liability does not apply to damage or
      loss caused by gross negligence or intent, or to personal injury.
    </li>
    <li>
      In addition and to the extent permitted by law, the COMPANY&#39;s
      liability is excluded or limited for (a) indirect and/or consequential
      damage or loss (such as lost profits, unrealized savings, additional
      expenses incurred by the Customer, or third-party claims); (b) damage or
      loss resulting from an act or omission of the Customer and/or a breach of
      the relevant contract by the Customer; and/or (c) any and all damage or
      loss that is beyond the COMPANY&#39;s reasonable control (including force
      majeure events). &nbsp;
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>7. Rights, Assignment, Transfer, and Pledge</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Rights and obligations arising from the contractual relationship, as well
      as the contract as a whole, may not be assigned, transferred, or pledged
      to third parties, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent
      of the other party, except in cases of transfer by universal succession.
      Said consent shall not be withheld without reason.
    </li>
    <li>
      Upon payment of the contractually agreed remuneration, the COMPANY shall
      grant the Customer the non-exclusive right, unrestricted in terms of
      location and time, to use the deliverables supplied by the COMPANY in
      accordance with their intended use for the agreed purpose. Any use beyond
      the agreed purpose is not permitted in order to protect the COMPANY&#39;s
      preliminary work and expertise.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>8. Applicable Law/Place of Jurisdiction</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The following shall apply to the legal relationship between the Customer
      as client and the service provider:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the concluded contract and/or the offer accepted by the Customer
        </li>
        <li>
          the SaaS terms of use, insofar as SaaS services are obtained from the

        </li>
        <li>these General Terms and Conditions</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      The contractual relationships entered into on the basis of these GTCs
      shall be governed exclusively by Swiss substantive law to the exclusion of

      (CISG) and conflict-of-laws rules.
