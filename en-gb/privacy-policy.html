  <h2>2. PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>

  <h3>2.1 DEFINITIONS</h3>

  <p>
    Personal data means all information relating to an identified or
    identifiable person. A data subject is a person whose data is processed.
    Processing means any operation involving personal data, irrespective of the
    means and procedures applied, and in particular the storage, disclosure,
    acquisition, collection, erasure, storage, alteration, destruction, and use
    of personal data.
  </p>
  <p>
    The European Economic Area (EEA) comprises the European Union (EU) and the
    Principality of Liechtenstein, Iceland, and Norway. The General Data
    Protection Regulation (GDPR) defines the processing of personal data as the
    processing of personal data relating to a specific natural person.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 LEGAL BASES</h3>
  <p>
    We process personal data in compliance with Swiss data protection law,
    including in particular the
    <a
      href="https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1945_1945_1945/en"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >Federal Act on Data Protection</a
    >&nbsp;(FADP) and the
    <a
      href="https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1962_1962_1962/en"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      Ordinance to the Federal Act on Data Protection
    </a>
    (DPO).
  </p>
  <p>
    If and insofar as the GDPR is applicable, we process personal data according
    to at least one of the following legal bases :
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Article 6(1)(b) GDPR where processing of personal data is necessary to
      perform a contract with the data subject and to take steps prior to
      entering into a contract.
    </li>
    <li>
      Article 6 (1)(f) GDPR where processing of personal data is necessary to
      safeguard our or third-party legitimate interests insofar as these
      interests are not overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms and
      the interests of the data subject. Legitimate interests are, in
      particular, our interest in providing our services in the long term and in
      a manner which is user-friendly, secure, and reliable as well as
      advertising these services if required; information security and
      protection against misuse and unauthorized use; exercising of our own
      legal claims; and compliance with Swiss law.
    </li>
    <li>
      Article 6 (1)(c) GDPR where processing of personal data is necessary to
      comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject under any
      applicable law of member states of the EEA.
    </li>
    <li>
      Article 6(1)(e) GDPR where processing of personal data is necessary to
      perform a task carried out in the public interest.
    </li>
    <li>
      Article 6(1)(a) GDPR to process personal data given with the data
      subject&#39;s consent.
    </li>
    <li>
      Article 6(1)(d) GDPR where processing of personal data is necessary to
      protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural
      person.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.3 NATURE, SCOPE, AND PURPOSE</h3>
  <p>
    We process personal data which is necessary to provide our services in the
    long term and in a manner which is user-friendly, secure, and reliable. Such
    personal data can fall into the following categories: master and contact
    data, browser and device data, content data, license data, metadata or
    peripheral data and usage data, location data or sales, contractual, and
    payment data.
  </p>
  <p>
    We process personal data for the period which is required for the relevant
    purpose or purposes or which is required by law. Personal data that no
    longer needs to be processed is anonymized or erased. Data subjects whose
    data we process in general have a right to erasure.
  </p>
  <p>
    In principle, we only process personal data after obtaining the data
    subject&#39;s consent unless processing is permissible for other legal
    reasons, such as to perform a contract with the data subject and to take
    steps prior to entering into a contract, to safeguard our overriding
    legitimate interests; because processing is evident from the circumstances;
    or based on prior information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Within this framework we process in particular the information which data
    subjects transmit to us voluntarily and themselves when establishing contact
    with us &ndash; for example by letter, email, contact form, social media, or
    telephone &ndash; or when registering for a user account. We may store such
    information in, for example, an address book or using similar means. If you
    transmit personal data to us via third parties, you are obliged to ensure
    data protection vis-&agrave;-vis said third parties and to ensure the
    correctness of said personal data.
  </p>
  <h3>
    2.4 PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA BY THIRD PARTIES, IN SWITZERLAND OR ABROAD
  </h3>
  <p>
    We may have personal data processed by contracted third parties or process
    it together with third parties or with the help of third parties as well as
    transmit this data to third parties. Such third parties are, in particular,
    providers whose services we use. Should we use such third parties, we will
    ensure an adequate level of data protection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Such third parties are, in principle, located in Switzerland and the EEA.
    Such third parties may, however, also be located in other states and
    territories around the world or elsewhere in the universe provided that,
    according to the
    <a
      href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home/data-protection/handel-und-wirtschaft/transborder-data-flows.html"
      target="_blank"

      >adequacy decision of the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information
      Commissioner
    </a>
    &nbsp;(FDPIC) and &ndash; if and insofar as the GDPR is applicable &ndash;
    according to the
    <a
      href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      adequacy decision of the European Commission
    </a>
    , their data protection law ensures adequate data protection or if, for
    other reasons, such as a corresponding contractual agreement, in particular
    based on standard contractual clauses, or corresponding certification,
    adequate data protection is ensured. In exceptional cases, such a third
    party may be located in a country without adequate data protection insofar
    as the prerequisites of data protection law, such as the data subject&#39;s
    explicit consent, are fulfilled.
  </p>

  <h2>3. RIGHTS OF DATA SUBJECTS</h2>
  <p>
    Swiss data protection law grants specific rights to data subjects whose
    personal data we process. These include the right to information and the
    right to rectification, erasure, or blocking of the processed personal data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Data subjects whose personal data we process may &ndash; if and insofar as
    the GDPR is applicable &ndash; demand, free of charge, a confirmation
    whether we are processing their personal data and, if so, information about
    the processing of their personal data; have processing of their personal
    data restricted; exercise their right to data portability; and exercise
    their right to have their personal data rectified, erased (&quot;right to be
    forgotten&quot;), blocked, or completed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Data subjects whose personal data we process may &ndash; if and insofar as
    the GDPR is applicable &ndash; withdraw any consent with effect for the
    future and object to processing of their personal data at any time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Data subjects whose personal data we process have a right to lodge a
    complaint with a responsible supervisory authority. The supervisory
    authority for data protection in Switzerland is the
    <a
      href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home/the-fdpic/contact.html"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner
    </a>
    (FDPIC).
  </p>

  <h2>4. DATA SECURITY</h2>
  <p>
    We take adequate and appropriate technical and organizational measures to
    ensure data protection and, in particular, data security. However, despite
    these measures, there may always be security gaps when personal data is
    processed on the internet. We cannot therefore guarantee absolute data
    security.
  </p>
  <p>
    Access to our online services is via transport encryption (SSL/TLS, in
    particular using Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, or HTTPS for short).
    Most browsers identify transport encryption with a padlock in the address
    bar.
  </p>
  <p>
    Access to our online services is &ndash; as is essentially the case with all
    internet use &ndash; subject to mass surveillance, even where no specific
    grounds or suspicions exist, and other surveillance by security agencies in
    Switzerland, the EU, the United States of America (USA), and other states.
    We have no direct influence over the associated processing of personal data
    by secret services, police authorities, and other security agencies.
  </p>

  <h2>5. USE OF THE WEBSITE</h2>
  <h3>5.1 COOKIES</h3>

  <p>
    We may use cookies for our website. Cookies &ndash; our own cookies
    (first-party cookies) and also cookies of third parties whose services we
    use (third-party cookies) &ndash; are data stored in your browser. Such
    stored data need not be limited to traditional cookies in text form. Cookies
    cannot execute programs or transmit malware such as trojans and viruses.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you visit our website, cookies can be temporarily stored in your
    browser as &quot;session cookies&quot; or for a predefined period of time as
    &quot;permanent cookies.&quot; Session cookies are automatically deleted
    when you close your browser. Permanent cookies are stored for a certain
    duration. Permanent cookies make it possible in particular to recognize your
    browser when you next visit our website and thus, for example, measure the
    website&#39;s reach. Permanent cookies can, however, also be used for
    purposes such as online marketing.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can fully or partially deactivate or delete cookies at any time by
    changing your browser settings. However, without cookies it may no longer be
    possible to use our website to its full extent. We will &ndash; if and
    insofar as necessary &ndash; actively request you to provide your express
    consent to the use of cookies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Where cookies are used to measure success and range or for advertising, it

  <h3>5.2 SERVER LOG FILES</h3>
  <p>
    Each time you visit our website, we are able to log the following
    information insofar as your browser transmits it to our server
    infrastructure or our web server is able to identify it: date and time
    including time zone; Internet Protocol (IP) address; access status (HTTP
    status code); operating system including user interface and version; browser
    including language and version; the sub-pages of our website which were
    accessed, including the transmitted data volume; and the last web page
    accessed in the same browser window (referrer).
  </p>
  <p>
    We store such information, which may also be personal data, in server log
    files. The information is necessary to provide our online services in the
    long term and in a user-friendly, reliable form as well as to ensure data
    security and thus in particular the protection of personal data &ndash;
    including by third parties or with the help of third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>6. NOTIFICATIONS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2>
  <p>
    We send notifications and announcements such as newsletters by email and via
    other communication channels such as instant messaging.
  </p>
  <h3>6.1 MEASUREMENT OF SUCCESS AND REACH</h3>
  <p>
    Notifications and announcements may contain web links or tracking pixels
    which record whether the specific notification was opened and which web
    links were clicked. Such web links and tracking pixels can also record the
    use of notifications and announcements by specific data subjects. We require
    this statistical recording of use for the purpose of measuring success and
    reach, which is in turn intended to ensure that notifications and
    announcements are based on recipients&#39; needs and reading habits and thus
    effective and user-friendly, as well as to be able to offer notifications
    and announcements in the long term and in a secure, reliable manner.
  </p>
  <h3>6.2 CONSENT AND OBJECTION</h3>
  <p>
    In principle, you must expressly consent to the use of your email address
    and your other contact addresses unless this use is permitted for other
    legal reasons. Wherever possible we use the &quot;double opt-in&quot;
    procedure when obtaining any consent to the receipt of emails. In other
    words, you receive an email with a web link which you must click as
    confirmation and to ensure that no unauthorized third parties can abuse your
    personal data. Such consents, including the IP address and the date and
    time, may be logged as evidence and for security reasons.
  </p>
  <p>
    In principle, you may unsubscribe from notifications and announcements such
    as newsletters at any time. Notifications and announcements which are
    absolutely essential for our services may be excluded from this. When you
    unsubscribe you can, in particular, object to the statistical recording of
    use for the purpose of measuring success and reach.
  </p>
  <h3>6.3 USE OF SERVICE PROVIDERS TO SEND NOTIFICATIONS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS</h3>
  <p>
    We use third-party services or rely on the support of service providers to
    transmit notifications and announcements. This may also entail the use of
    cookies. We ensure an adequate level of data protection when using such
    services.

  <h2>7. SOCIAL MEDIA</h2>
  <p>
    We have a presence on social media platforms and other online platforms so
    that we can communicate with interested parties and provide information
    about our services. Personal data generated in this context may also be
    processed outside of Switzerland and the EEA.
  </p>
  <p>
    In each case, the general terms and conditions, the terms of use, and the
    privacy policies and other terms and conditions of the relevant operators of
    such online platforms will also apply. These terms provide specific
    information concerning the rights of data subjects, including in particular
    the right to information.
  </p>
  <h2>8. SUCCESS AND REACH MEASUREMENT</h2>
  <h3>GOOGLE ANALYTICS</h3>
  <p>
    We use Google Analytics to analyze how our website is used, which also
    enables us, for example, to measure its reach and the success of third-party
    links to our website. This is a service of Google LLC in the USA.
    <a
      href="https://www.blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/some-changes-our-service-model-europe/"

      >Google Ireland Limited</a
    >, located in Eire, is responsible for users in the EEA and Switzerland.
  </p>
  <p>
    Google also attempts to record individual visitors to our website who use
    multiple browsers or devices (cross-device tracking). This also entails the
    use of cookies. Google Analytics requires your IP address; however this
    information is kept separate from other Google data.
  </p>
  <p>
    In all cases we have your IP address anonymized before it is analyzed by
    Google. This means that your full IP address is, in principle, not
    transmitted to Google in the USA.

  <h2>9. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h2>
  <p>
    We use third-party services so that we can provide our services in the long
    term and in a manner which is user-friendly, secure, and reliable. Such
    services also allow us to embed content in our website. These services
    &ndash; for example, hosting and storage services, video services, and
    payment services &ndash; require your IP address since they would not
    otherwise be able to transmit the relevant content. Such services may be
    located outside of Switzerland and the EEA provided that adequate data
    protection is ensured.
  </p>
  <p>
    Third parties whose services we use may also process data related to our
    services and from other sources &ndash; including cookies, log files, and
    tracking pixels &ndash; in an aggregated, anonymized, or pseudonymized
    manner for their own security, statistical, and technical purposes.
  </p>
  <h3>9.1 DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE</h3>
  <p>
    We use the services of third parties in order to be able to access the
    digital infrastructure required for our services. These include in
    particular hosting and storage services from specialized providers.
